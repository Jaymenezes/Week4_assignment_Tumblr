## Tumblr

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to create custom navigation. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Tumblr.

Time spent: `<8>`

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- [x] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.

#### Optional

- [x] Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
- [x] Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
- [x] Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] homeSpin rotates infintely on home Screen
- [x] LoginViewController fades in
- [x] Cancel Button on LoginVC is highlighted on touch
- [x] Buttons animate off the screen when composeVC is dismissed 
- [x] all the VC's have scroll to suggest animation 
- [x] loading animation when user clicks SearchViewController tab


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I couldn't figure out why my loginVC was not transparent, since overCurrent Context was selected and the View had alpha < 1
2. Animation on search Icon works only when app is loaded

### Video Walkthrough
